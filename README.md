# Pre-trained models to classify structural cracks with resnet18

Pre-trained models to classify structural cracks with resnet18 in PyTorch (between the negative and positive samples); The particular pre-trained model will be resnet18;

Crack detection has vital importance for structural health monitoring and inspection. We would like to train a network to detect Cracks, we will denote the images that contain cracks as positive and images with no cracks as negative
